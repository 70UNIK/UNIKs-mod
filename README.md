# UNIK's Mod!
A standalone mod that adds what I want. A bit more unbalanced compared with Vanilla, but not as bad as some more unbalanced mods out there.

![alt text](image-1.png)

Requires Steamodded smods-1.0.0-beta-1016c or higher, Lovely v0.7.1 or higher. Cdataman/Talisman can be used to increase the scoring cap but isnt necessarily required.

It's recommended to pair this with Paperback and Bunco, goes well together with them and this mod completely overhauls linked groups in the latter.

## MAJOR FEATURES:
- 80+ Jokers to play around with!
- - 15 Common
- - 29 Uncommon
- - 30 Rare
- - 1 Legendary (With a secret method of obtaining)
- - 6 Ancients, very powerful Jokers stronger than Legendaries
- 18 "Detrimental" Jokers that will hinder you and can only be obtained in certain conditions
- 4 Enhancements, including a Wild Card buff
- 7 Editions, 5 of which are detrimental
- 2 Vouchers
- 6 Decks, 3 of which are edition-based
- 15 Tags, although 10 of them are detrimental
- 7 Boosters
- 2 New consumable types:
- - Summit Cards: Upgrade your cards by adding Mult and Chip bonuses! There are even rare consumable variants of those that add (Small) exponents.
- - Lartceps Cards: Hope you don't encounter Epic Blinds, that blind will force you to select one of those consumables, which will severely hurt you.
- 4 Tarots
- 1 New seal
- 5 Planets (from other mods)
- 11 Spectrals
- 57 Blinds
- - 17 regulars
- - 15 Finishers
- - 16 "Epic Blinds", really hard blinds that punish your run and only appear at higher overshoot values.
- - 7 "Legendary Blinds", which is basically death.
- Overshoot, a mechanic that punishes really high scoring runs by increasing ante increase and summoning in the afforementioned Epic Blinds.
- 8 Stickers
- 2 Stakes including a reworked Blue Stake

This mod also contains many crossmod content such as for:
- Paperback
- Bunco
- Grab Bag
- MoreFluff
- Finity
- Blind Editions
- Cryptid, which includes balancing changes for some Cryptid Jokers, such as the infamous Canvas (Now legendary and nerfed) and Oil Lamp (Immutable and increases values by X1.2 onces). They are a carryover from the Balanced Branch and is considered legacy content (as I am no longer in the business of maintaining it as much) so they may be unbalanced or buggy.

While all art is done by me, art for the Spectrum-based Jokers and Planets are from Bunco and Bulwark is from Cryptid and most of the code is mainly of my conception, although various ideas on Blinds, Characters and code are derived from others.
