# UNIK's Mod!
A standalone mod that adds what I want. It is unbalanced compared to Vanilla though more tame compared with Cryptid.

Requires Steamodded smods-1.0.0-beta-0827c or higher, Lovely v0.7.1 or higher. Talisman can be used to increase the scoring cap but isnt necessarily required.

This mod also contains many crossmod content such as for:
- Paperback
- Grab Bag
- Finity
- Cryptid, which includes balancing changes for some Cryptid Jokers, such as the infamous Canvas (Now legendary and nerfed) and Oil Lamp (Immutable and increases values by X1.2 onces). They are still WIP and a carryover from the Balanced Branch so they may be unbalanced or buggy.

While most of my artwork is done by me, art for the Spectrum-based Jokers and Planets are from Bunco and most of the code is mainly of my conception, although various ideas on Blinds, Characters and code are derived from others

#### KNOWN ISSUES:
If my mod is renamed in any way while Talisman is active, this unknown crash occurs.

I don't know what the hell is going on with this, but the only workaround so far is renaming the mod file to "-BALATRO-UNIK-s-Mod" (excluding quotations).
